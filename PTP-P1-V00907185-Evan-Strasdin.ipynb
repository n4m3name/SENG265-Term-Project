    "5. How prevalent is Unix or Linux in software development today?\n",
    "   - In short, Unix/Linux is like the C of operating systems: We wouldn't have the more popular options without it as it's their foundation. It's used extensively for servers and non-pc devices, albeit has quite a few users (myself included) who prefer it's functionality over less transparent OS's such as MacOS and Microsoft.\n",
    "6.  What are the most popular programming languages and why?\n",
    "   - Python comes first since it is by far the easiest language to write. Others include Java, JS/CSS and HTML, C and C++.\n",
    "   - C is popular because it's about the closest you can get to writing assembly without having to write assembly - if you want a fast program that does exactly what you tell it to, C and C++ are the way to go. They also have extensive libraries which (once you know what they are) make writing code fairly easy\n",
    "   - Java is popular because of it's portability, but as of late I don't see ths being a standout feature of java over any other programming language. It is also my least favorite to write.\n",
    "7.  Describe the fundamental differences between C and Python.\n",
    "   - The main difference is that C is a low-level language (pretty much a step up from assembly) and Python is pretty much the highest-level language.\n",
    "8.  How challenging were learning C and completing Assignment 1 for you?\n",
    "   - It was initially very challenging but once I figured out pointers and got into a 'groove' with chatGPT I found it easier to use than Java, granted I was not using the stack or dynamic memory.\n",
    "9.  **Required**: What are your personal insights, aha moments, and epiphanies you experienced in the first part of the SENG 265 course?\n",
    "   - The most significant insight I've had so far is how important it is to know how to *really* know bash. After I had written a couple simple scripts to automate lab server tasks I had a moment of awe at how powerful it could be - you can automate absolutely anything that a computer could do as long as you can figure out how to do it.\n",
    "   - This is less of an epiphany, but still significant: After learning a bit of C for the first assignment, other languages are starting to make more sense, especially when it comes to pointers/pass-by-value/ref.\n",
    "10. **Required**: How did you experience chatGPT as a learning tool?\n",

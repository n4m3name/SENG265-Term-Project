    "1. **Required**. Describe your continued learning experience in SENG 265. Make it a weekly habit to document your learning experience.\n",
    "   - The entire document serves as a 'weekly learning experience' notebook - The weeks during which specific materials were covered are included in the [table of contentes](#table-of-contents).\n",
    "2. What is the core functionality of Jupyter Notebooks?\n",
    "   - [About notebooks, magics](#about-notebooks-magics)\n",
    "3. Summarize simple Jupyter Notebook markdown including how to insert links and images?\n",

    "5. How prevalent is Unix or Linux in software development today?\n",
    "   - In short, Unix/Linux is like the C of operating systems: We wouldn't have the more popular options without it as it's their foundation. It's used extensively for servers and non-pc devices, albeit has quite a few users (myself included) who prefer it's functionality over less transparent OS's such as MacOS and Microsoft.\n",
    "6.  What are the most popular programming languages and why?\n",
    "   - Python comes first since it is by far the easiest language to write. Others include Java, JS/CSS and HTML, C and C++.\n",
    "   - C is popular because it's about the closest you can get to writing assembly without having to write assembly - if you want a fast program that does exactly what you tell it to, C and C++ are the way to go. They also have extensive libraries which (once you know what they are) make writing code fairly easy\n",
    "   - Java is popular because of it's portability, but as of late I don't see ths being a standout feature of java over any other programming language. It is also my least favorite to write.\n",
    "7.  Describe the fundamental differences between C and Python.\n",
    "   - The main difference is that C is a low-level language (pretty much a step up from assembly) and Python is pretty much the highest-level language.\n",
    "8.  How challenging were learning C and completing Assignment 1 for you?\n",
    "   - It was initially very challenging but once I figured out pointers and got into a 'groove' with chatGPT I found it easier to use than Java, granted I was not using the stack or dynamic memory.\n",
    "9.  **Required**: What are your personal insights, aha moments, and epiphanies you experienced in the first part of the SENG 265 course?\n",
    "   - The most significant insight I've had so far is how important it is to know how to *really* know bash. After I had written a couple simple scripts to automate lab server tasks I had a moment of awe at how powerful it could be - you can automate absolutely anything that a computer could do as long as you can figure out how to do it.\n",
    "   - This is less of an epiphany, but still significant: After learning a bit of C for the first assignment, other languages are starting to make more sense, especially when it comes to pointers/pass-by-value/ref.\n",
    "10. **Required**: How did you experience chatGPT as a learning tool?\n",
    "   - [Introduction: Jupyter Magics](#introduction-jupyter-magics-creating-a-table-of-contents)\n",
    "   - [A note on call-by-reference and call-by-value](#a-note-on-call-by-reference-and-call-by-value)\n",
    "   - I've found chatGPT is extremely helpful for small, explicitly defined tasks. For example:\n",
    "     - I had it write me a minimal .config file for conky, a system manager\n",
    "     - I frequently have it write examples of code using specific functions to see how they're used in context\n",
    "     - It usually gives a better response than google in far less time"

    "1. Describe the notion of and motivation for typing and typing hints in Python. The strongly typed programming language Rust is rapidly being adopted by companies and is used to improve the performance of Python. Why is Rust getting so popular? Does typing play a role?\n",

    "\n",
    "19. **Required:** How did you experience Generative AI (e.g., chatGPT or Copilot) as a learning tool? This answer must be different from what you answered in TPP1 (i.e., the assumption is that you got to know chatGPT in the first part of the course and you really used it in the second part of the course).\n",
    "    - Throughout the course I've gone from forgetting that chatGPT exists to going to it almost exclusively for help with almost any kind of problem solving. As I mentioned in my answer to pt.1, it's been far more helpful that google.\n",
    "    - During the second portion of the course I think I still use it in a similar way, I just use it a lot more and for things that have nothing to do with code! For example where I started using it to solve small problems I was having when coding projects, I now ask it more general questions that I would normally ask google, i.e. for movie recommendations - the other day I even suggested my sister use it to find poetry for a paper she was writing. It turned this decent-sized task into one that took seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "20. **Required:** What are your personal insights, aha moments, and epiphanies you experienced in the second part of the SENG 265 course?\n",
    "    - The biggest epiphany I've had (thus the addition of the large Python section to this file) has been that I had zero idea how to use python 'properly' (I probably still don't, it will take some practice). I think I took it for granted since when starting out you don't see any of the more useful features as those mentioned above: I was using it almost exclusively in a notebook which - while very helpful for quick code, note-taking and math help; doesn't do the language justice. It is quite a bit more straightforward than C in terms of making scripts/full-blown projects and while I still prefer coding smaller school projects in C (it feels a lot more 'straight-forward') I think that as I continue to improve my python skills it will end up as my go-to language."
